# NLP - Improving Cross-Domain Relation Classification by Adding Domain-Specific Context

A natural language processing university project, where we used a cross-domain dataset and a state-of-the-art neural network classifier to investigate the performance of adding more context to the dataset dataset.

*What we discovered was that by adding a special token with a domain name (e.g. [music]), we can slightly increase the performance of a cross-domain relation classification model.*

## Important Details
- group work: our team consisted of 3 people
- our work is based on [Bassignana and Plank (2022a)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.263/)
- the submission was an academic paper + code
